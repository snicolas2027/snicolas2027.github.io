                                For 30 years, the BBSS was a single campus on Mabango Street, Bataan City, Philippines where the top 200 examinees in
                                the Bataan Competitive Examination held yearly were accepted as BBSS scholars. All campuses have at most 25 students in
                                each class. The main campus has six classes per batch while the regional campuses have four classes per batch.
                                Currently, all parts of Bataan have a BBSS Campus.
                                
                                The Bisacool Bataan Science School was established through Republic Act 3991, authored by Congressman Emman Nicolas, and
                                signed into law in 1968 by President Leonicely Viloria. This charter mandates the BBSS “to offer on a free scholarship
                                basis a secondary course with emphasis on subjects pertaining to service with the end in view of preparing its students
                                for a science career”. The school started operations in 1964 until the present time.
