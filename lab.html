                                <p>There are laboratories in our Bisacool Bataan Science School where experiments and
                                    scientific research are performed.
                                    Our school's laboratories assist students in better understanding topics and
                                    applying their learning to practical
                                    situations. Students learn to utilize scientific tools and norms, which will help
                                    them grasp the nature of science. By
                                    this, it is critical to comprehend the digestive system because it plays a
                                    significant function in everyone's general
                                    health by providing nutrients to our bodies. We must be mindful that our bodies need
                                    nutrients from food to function
                                    effectively and be healthy. It is also crucial to understand how each of our organs
                                    functions in our digestive system so
                                    we know how to care for these organs in our bodies. We, students, have recently
                                    performed an activity that simulates the
                                    steps of food processing, which helps us learn how the digestive system works. It
                                    displays the breakdown of food into
                                    nutrients that the body may use for energy, cell repair, and development. It teaches
                                    the six digestive processes:
                                    ingestion, digestion, absorption, and extraction, using alternate materials to
                                    demonstrate amusingly and easily how they
                                    function.

                                        <h3>Crushing Stage</h3>
                                        <p>The stage where we put the banana and crackers in a zip lock simulates the
                                            process of ingestion where large
                                            complex
                                            molecules are ingested or eaten as the banana and crackers represent food
                                            and the zip lock represents the
                                            stomach.
                                            During the swallowing stage, we observed that we had combined the banana,
                                            crackers, and lemon juice with
                                            water. This
                                            mimicked swallowing by simulating saliva from the mouth. Salivary glands
                                            produce saliva, a digestive liquid
                                            that helps
                                            food pass more smoothly through the esophagus and into the stomach. During
                                            the swallowing and crushing
                                            stage, we noticed
                                            that we put the crackers, banana, water, and lemon juice in a zip-locked
                                            bag. This simulation mimicked the
                                            ingestion
                                            where large complex molecules are broken down into small pieces as the
                                            zip-locked bag represents the
                                            stomach. During the
                                            crushing stage, we noticed that the food became smaller. This simulates the
                                            first step of digestion which
                                            increases the
                                            surface area of food to allow a more efficient breakdown by enzymes. It also
                                            mimicked the action of the
                                            stomach. During
                                            the addition of orange juice or the digestion and absorption stage, we
                                            noticed the insides of the stomach or
                                            the zip
                                            lock bag turn into a soup-like liquid. Orange juice represents stomach acids
                                            that break down the food, kill
                                            bacteria,
                                            and the digestive enzymes split up the proteins. We think that the food
                                            within the zip lock bag includes
                                            biological
                                            substances such as proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and lipids.</p>

                                        <p>The liquid pouring from the stocking demonstrates osmosis and water absorption in the small intestines. The tray depicts
                                        the intestinal lumen. The feces are represented by the stuff left in the stocking. Pushing the partially hardened
                                        material from the tights demonstrates extraction. Once the stomach contents feel like a thick soup liquid, we cut a tiny
                                        hole in one corner and slowly press into the tights or stocking (small intestine). The small intestine is made up of
                                        several thin structures known as villi. These have a vast surface area for absorbing food molecules. We hold the tights
                                        over the tray and slowly squeeze the liquid out. The liquid in the tray indicates the nutrients that the body receives
                                        and utilizes. Food left behind the tights symbolizes waste items that cannot be digested.</p>

                                        <p>The most absorbent paper towel is the four-folded paper towel. The paper towels absorbed water since the layers
                                        generated air spaces. A small intestine is an organ in the digestive system that can be compared to a paper towel. Paper
                                        towels absorb water, and villi absorb digested food. The villi, like paper towels, have a larger surface area into which
                                        substances can be absorbed. A thicker towel, such as a four-folded paper towel, has more fibers to absorb water. Tissue
                                        and paper towel fibers are composed of cellulose molecules.

</h3>
                                        <p>The citrus juice stimulates bile movement in the small intestine by breaking down the vegetable oil, which then combines
                                        with the water in cup B. It's comparable to bile in the small intestine breaking down lipids into fatty acids. The
                                        purpose of the bile is to help in the digestion of lipids in the duodenum. Bile is a fluid produced and retained in the
                                        gallbladder by the liver that aids digestion and breaks down lipids into fatty acids. Emulsification is the action of
                                        bile on fat and is an example of mechanical digestion. Since humans eat so quickly, the amylase contained in saliva
                                        digests little carbs while food is in the mouth. Bile is a mechanical digestion that contributes to the surface area to
                                        volume ratio, making enzymes more likely to break down lipids entirely.

                                <p>In the end, we had a lot of fun with the considerably engaging experiment activity, which expanded our ideas and
                                understanding about the phases of food processing, simulation of absorption, and bile action. Although it was a
                                hilarious experience to do the experiment activity during the food processing stage, we felt enjoyment. After the
                                experiment, we can now answer the question that comes to our minds every day, such as "What happens to our food after we
                                eat it?", "Why do more paper towels absorb more water?", and other human or real-life situations relating to the
                                functions of the digestive systems and concluding a scientific explanation.
