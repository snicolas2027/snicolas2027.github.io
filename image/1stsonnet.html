                        Why can't we just once, say what we want, say what we feel, (A)
                        <br>Was it just me who felt those lingering feelings every time our eyes met? (B)
                        <br>Why can't we admit, accept, and stop having second thoughts we conceal, (A)
                        <br>The feelings we felt were still there, are you not sure or are we anxious to concede it yet?
                        (B)

                        <br><br>It feels untouched yet humble, feels peculiar yet vague, weird yet feels somewhat right
                        (C)
                        <br>Can't seem to capture this feeling, feels so surreal, so risky (D)
                        <br>Small things appear to be a lot more to me as you showed me a life with daylight (C)
                        <br>I am trapped with your enchantments, clueless about my feelings, so tricky (D)

                        <br><br>He secrets his passions, but I see through, undone. (E)
                        <br>I would waver the world to make him smile (F)
                        <br>Reveals the secrets he tries to conceal from anyone, (E)
                        <br>To see his laughter bloom, even if it's just for a while (F)

                        <br><br>So why can't we for once take a chance together and embrace the untold, (G)
                        <br>Where echoes of adventure drift upon the skies and new chapters unfold. (G)

                        <br>Than dandelion fluff in the sunlight

                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        The sonnet expresses a desire for someone to take a chance on a romantic relationship. It
                        explores the protagonist's infatuation with a man who is enthusiastic but cautious, despite
                        their deep affection. The poem highlights the importance of taking risks and not dwelling on
                        missed opportunities. This sonnet aims to inspire courage and love, highlighting the value of
                        connection and passion in relationships, as well as encouraging individuals to embrace love and
                        take risks in their lives.
